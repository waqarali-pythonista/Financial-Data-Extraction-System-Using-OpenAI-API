Financial Data Extraction System Using OpenAI API 



Description:
This repository contains code for a Financial Data Extraction System utilizing the OpenAI API. The system is designed to extract key financial metrics such as company name, revenue, net income, earnings per share (EPS), and corresponding stock symbols from either a pasted news article or a provided website URL. The extraction process leverages OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5 model, enabling accurate and efficient data retrieval.

Features:

Flexible Extraction Methods: Users can choose between pasting a financial news article or entering a website URL to extract relevant financial data.
Automated Data Retrieval: The system utilizes the OpenAI API to automatically extract financial metrics from textual input, ensuring consistency and reliability.
Intuitive User Interface: Implemented using Streamlit, the interface provides a user-friendly experience with options for input and clear presentation of extracted data.
Error Handling: The system gracefully handles cases where the required financial data cannot be found, maintaining robustness and usability.



Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Obtain an API key for OpenAI and store it in a file named secret_key.py.
Run the application using Python, and interact with the interface to extract financial data.
Contributing:
Contributions to enhance the system's functionality, improve performance, or address issues are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review. Be sure to follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.
